# Extension List

To expand the functionality of your PostgreSQL database, you can use extensions.

Over 300 extensions are available for [installation](/docs/extensions/install), including contrib extensions bundled with PostgreSQL, as well as third-party extensions from the official PGDG repository and others, such as the Pigsty repository.
