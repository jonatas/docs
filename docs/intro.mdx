# Introduction

**[postgresql_cluster](https://github.com/vitabaks/postgresql_cluster)** automates the deployment and management of highly available PostgreSQL clusters in production environments. This solution is tailored for use on dedicated physical servers, virtual machines, and within both on-premises and cloud-based infrastructures.

### Supported setups of Postgres Cluster

import SchemeSwitcher from '@site/src/components/SchemeSwitcher.mdx';

<SchemeSwitcher />

For a detailed description of the cluster components, visit the [Architecture](./overview/architecture.md) page.

## Getting Started

### Run the Console container

To run the PostgreSQL Cluster Console, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name pg-console \
  --publish 80:80 \
  --publish 8080:8080 \
  --env PG_CONSOLE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1 \
  --env PG_CONSOLE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=secret_token \
  --volume console_postgres:/var/lib/postgresql \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --volume /tmp/ansible:/tmp/ansible \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  vitabaks/postgresql_cluster_console:2.0.0
```

:::tip
It is recommended to run the console in the same network as your database servers to enable monitoring of the cluster status. In this case, replace `localhost` with your server's IP address in the PG_CONSOLE_API_URL variable.
:::

### Open the Console UI

Open the console UI at the following address: http://localhost/

Use `secret_token` for authorization.

:::note
- If you have set up the console on a different server, replace 'localhost' with the server's address.
- Use the value of your token if you have redefined it in the PG_CONSOLE_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN variable.
