# Support

## Community support

This support is provided by the project community and is available to all users through the GitHub repository [issues](https://github.com/vitabaks/postgresql_cluster/issues) section.\
It is a free service, but it does not guarantee a specific response time, relying instead on the availability and goodwill of community members.

## Individual support

This support is offered through a subscription program for project [sponsors](./sponsor.md). It includes personalized assistance with a guaranteed response time depending on the chosen plan. Sponsors have access to a private, dedicated Slack channel for direct communication and support.

#### Choose the support plan that fits your needs:
